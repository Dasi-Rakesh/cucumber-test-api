# Cucumber and TestNG Maven Project

This is a basic example of a Maven project for running Cucumber tests with TestNG. It includes a sample project structure and configuration to get you started with your own Cucumber-based test automation.

## Project Structure

The project structure is as follows:

```
cucumber-test/
├── src/
│   ├── main/
│   │   └── java/                # Application source code (if applicable)
│   └── test/
│       ├── java/                # Test code and step definitions
│       │   └── com/
│       │       └── searchAPI/
│       │           ├── ITunesSearchAPIRunner            # TestNG runner class
│       │           └── ITunesSearchAPIStepDefinitions   # Cucumber step definitions
│       └── resources/
│           └── features/          # Cucumber feature files
├── pom.xml                        # Maven configuration file
└── README.md                      # This README file
```

## Dependencies

This project uses the following dependencies:

- [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/): A tool for behavior-driven development (BDD).
- [TestNG](https://testng.org/): A testing framework for Java.
- [RestAssured](https://rest-assured.io/): A library for testing RESTful web services.


## Getting Started

   [Download Cucumber and TestNG Maven Project](https://github.com/Dasi-Rakesh/cucumber-test-api)

2. Configure your development environment and ensure you have Maven installed.


## Getting Started

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Configure your development environment and ensure you have Maven installed.

3. Create your Cucumber feature files in the `src/test/resources/features` directory.

4. Implement your Cucumber step definitions in the `src/test/java` directory.

5. Update the TestNG runner class (`CucumberTestRunner.java`) to specify your feature file locations and glue packages.

6. Run your Cucumber tests using Maven with the following command:

```bash
mvn clean test
```

## Customize the Project

You can customize this project according to your specific requirements. Here are some common customization tasks:

- Update the Cucumber feature files in `src/test/resources/features` with your own scenarios.

- Implement step definitions in `src/test/java/com/example/stepdefs` for your feature files.

- Add additional dependencies in the `pom.xml` file as needed for your project.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while running the tests, check the following:

- Ensure that your project's dependencies are correctly configured in the `pom.xml` file.

- Verify that your Cucumber feature files and step definitions are correctly located in the project structure.

- Check for any errors or warnings in your development environment.
